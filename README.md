        <p>Today was a normal day for me. I woke up at 7am to review for a history quiz I had today. After I reviewed for my quiz, I ate my breakfast, and thankfully I managed to eat my food quickly today. As a result, I was able to to arrive on time to school, which made my mom profoundly happy. School was normal for me as nothing exciting happened. In school, I just talked with my friends  <img class= "day" src= "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Khan_Academy_logo.svg">
about sports and our studies, and I performed exceptionally well on my history quiz as I got a 99%, sadly not a 100%. When I arrived at home, I did my homework, watched the live hockey matches, hopefully I get achieve a level 4. The best part of the day was that I managed to complete most of the <img class= "day" src= "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/World_War_1_-_Mobilized_forces_per_total_population_%28in_%25%29.png">projects on Khan Acadamy regarding HTML, let's see if I can finish all of them by tomorrow.
